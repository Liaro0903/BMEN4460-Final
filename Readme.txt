Modified MedSegDiff to run with TABS dataset. 
Original code in DIFF_OG, modified code in DIFF_model

Attempted addition of validation in train_util_new. Testing showed needed
around 30 seconds to perform image generation for one test image. Concluded
addition of validation loss as too computationally expensive.

Adjusted code in:
scripts/segmentation_train.py
scripts/segmentation_sample.py
guided_diffusion/script_util
guided_diffusion/isicloader.py

Code for performance on test sample in guided_diffusion/test_data_evaluation

test mask images generated by running segmentation_sample.py using trained model
evaluated in the notebook mentioned above
