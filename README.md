## TABS Model
Modified TABS model to run with data augmentation and Whole Head (WH) dataset

Adjusted code in:
TABS_model/train.py
TABS_model/test.py

To train the model, adjust the directory in the train.py and run
```
python train.py
```
with the appropriate arguments.


To test the model, adjust the directory in the test.py and run
```
python test.py
```
with the appropriate arguments.

## Diffusion Model

Modified MedSegDiff to run with TABS dataset. 
Original code in DIFF_OG, modified code in DIFF_model

Attempted addition of validation in train_util_new. Testing showed needed
around 30 seconds to perform image generation for one test image. Concluded
addition of validation loss as too computationally expensive.

Adjusted code in:
DIFF_model/scripts/segmentation_train.py
DIFF_model/scripts/segmentation_sample.py
DIFF_model/guided_diffusion/script_util
DIFF_model/guided_diffusion/isicloader.py

Code for performance on test sample in guided_diffusion/test_data_evaluation

test mask images generated by running segmentation_sample.py using trained model
evaluated in the notebook mentioned above
